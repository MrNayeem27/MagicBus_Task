            Earth is the only 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet">planet</a> known to support 
            <a href="life">life,</a>
            and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. 
            Within the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System">Solar System,</a> 
            it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet">terrestrial planet</a> 
            and the fifth largest overall. 
            Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate">temperate</a> 
            zones, 
             and a wide 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator">equatorial</a> 
            tropical to 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical">subtropical</a> 
            region.<sup>[8]</sup> 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation">Precipitation</a>
            varies widely with location, 
            from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. 
            The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)">Northern Hemisphere.</a>

            Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. 
            The 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)">outer surface</a>
            is divided into several gradually migrating 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_plate">tectonic plates.</a> 
            The interior remains active, 
            with a thick layer of plastic 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)">mantle</a> 
            and an iron-filled core that generates a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field">magnetic field.</a> 
            This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. 
            Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

            The 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere">atmospheric</a> 
            conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,
            <sup>[9]</sup>which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. 
            Despite the wide regional variations in climate by 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitude</a>
            and other geographic factors, 
            the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,
            <sup>[10]</sup> and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, 
            and on the actual geography of the Earth.<sup>[11]</sup><sup>[12]</sup>
